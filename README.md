# Speech Recognition and Analysis Pipeline




This project demonstrates a complete **speech processing and recognition pipeline** in Python.  
It includes:
- Audio visualization (waveform and spectrogram)
- Pre-processing using **pre-emphasis filtering**
- Speech recognition using both **Google Speech Recognition API** and **OpenAI Whisper**
- Performance evaluation with **Word Error Rate (WER)** and **Character Error Rate (CER)**
- Batch transcription of multiple audio files
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** synthesis using Google gTTS


## 🚀 Features

✅ Load and visualize audio (`.wav`) files  
✅ Compute and display spectrograms  
✅ Apply **pre-emphasis filtering** to enhance speech clarity  
✅ Transcribe speech using:
    - Google Speech Recognition API (online)
    - OpenAI Whisper model (offline, multilingual)  
✅ Calculate **WER** and **CER** for transcription quality comparison  
✅ Batch-transcribe entire folders of audio files  
✅ Convert text into speech (`gTTS`) and generate `.mp3` files


## 🧩 Installation
